# Solar Radiation Forecast
These Python scripts perform the forecast of the solar radiation (W/m^2) for a given time period.
The solar radiation forecast is sent to an MQTT broker, with an associated timestamp. Relevant variables are also looged in a local .csv file.

An example of the forecast for (lat,lon) = (45.065262,7.659192) can be found here: https://linksboard.polito.it/dashboard/355f6f90-85e6-11e9-acf5-fb7ea3e0493d?publicId=8bc0b440-85f3-11e9-acf5-fb7ea3e0493d
